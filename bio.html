	<p>Studying law at Sydney University Alice was heavily involved in the Improvised Comedy scene and the Faculty Revues over 5 years of writing, directing, producing and performing.</p>

	<p>During her Masters in English Literature (Rhetoric) at Cambridge, she carried her love of sketch comedy writing and performing into the Cambridge Footlights. </p>

	<p>Arriving in New York, in the absence of an ensemble sketch crew, she began to focus on stand-up comedy, and since then, she has performed in every country she's lived in, including Sydney, Cambridge, New York and London.</p>

	<p>In 2011, she returned from New York to work full time as a lawyer at Allens Linklaters, returning to the Sydney comedy scene to win the inaugural Homebake Comedy Competition, and have since given up law to pursue comedy and writing full time. Alice is regular MC and headliner around Sydney and is open for bookings to perform at corporate events , private functions and club nights. Click here to contact Alice</p>

	<p>"To watch Alice perform is like receiving a bunch of comedy flowers... it's choc full of colours, laughs and just a delight to see."</p>

	 <p>- A Mic in Hand </p>

	 <p>"Charming, Brilliant and Unexpected." </p>

	 <p>- New York Comedy Cellar ï»¿ "Alice is funny, and smart and a wee bit wrong, but more than that, she has composure; assured, joyful composure. It's an edge more experienced comics would love."</p>
