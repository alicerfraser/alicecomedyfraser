<title>CapperCast Teacast - Nick Capper</title>
<itunes:author>Alice Fraser</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>Values and all that</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>In a cavernous cafe in Melbourne, Alice sits down with Nick Capper and talks about the value of value, whether we should be careful or not careful with what we say and a lot of other things. 

This chat happened chronologically BEFORE last week's chat with Toby Halligan, so some of the ideas here are amoebic forms of what was discussed 'last week'. Ah, time travel.
