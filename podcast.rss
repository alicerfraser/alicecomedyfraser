<title>Airless CarCast - Claire Hooper and Women of Letters</title>
<itunes:author>Alice Fraser</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>Running out of Oxygen, but still full of ideas.</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>Alice sits in a car with Claire Hooper in the carpark of Splendour in The Grass. As they slowly run out of oxygen, they talk about anxiety, what's the point of the news, the ethical downsides of being right about anything, Alice's million dollar idea, and how Claire as a new mother feels sorry for Pedophiles.

Appended at the end is Alice's Women of Letters performance, for people who don't mind sad things that aren't funny. 

Thanks to Bryce Halliday for the Audio Edit. http://brycehalliday.com

<itunes:subtitle>Values and all that</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>In a cavernous cafe in Melbourne, Alice sits down with Nick Capper and talks about the value of value, whether we should be careful or not careful with what we say and a lot of other things. 

This chat happened chronologically BEFORE last week's chat with Toby Halligan, so some of the ideas here are amoebic forms of what was discussed 'last week'. Ah, time travel.

<title>Tea's A Crowd or a Fourcast Teacast</title>
<itunes:author>Alice Fraser</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>Adam Yardley, Fiona Yardley and Richard Parkin and A Baby and A Plane</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>Alice has tea and talks in a remarkably civilised fourway throwdown about violence and criminality. Chapter titles if you want to skip ahead or back are as follows:

4.50 minutes in – Punching for no reason.
9.05 mins – Gendered dreams [do babies dream of electric babies?].
13.20 – Aggression as a problem solving tool, violent fantasies and masculine heroism.
17 mins – The righteous smashing!
20 mins – A heavily visual joke…
21 mins - Swimming in salt water; complicated grief.
24 mins – The transcendental beauty of the imperfect...
26 mins – Criminality and Criminology.
30 mins – No-one wants to be an arsehole? 
33 mins - Passive Aggression is not that bad.
