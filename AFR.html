<p>Fraser, who knew from the outset she was better suited to a different job. "I did the graduate program at Allens - square peg round hole. It was literally like every time I walked into a room people would stare at me strangely," she says.
Educated in Sydney and at Cambridge, Fraser has done stand-up in New York city and locally. She said it was a matter of priorities being revealed, rather than decided.</p>

<p>"When you spend the last three hours of your workday doing something else, you realise that that's what is important to you."</p>

<p>"There's a rhetoric that people buy into in those firms which is, if you drop out, you're weak. But the reality is that I have a different preference, or I have different skills. I'm better at other stuff. That doesn't make me a bad human being."</p>

<p>Alice Fraser, who left Allens to do comedy full-time, say [s her]... corporate experience has been invaluable. "I find it much easier to do comedy now I've done law," Fraser says. "You know what a work ethic looks like and I know exactly how much my time is worth."</p>

<p>"It is an unsettling thing to interview comedians who speak fluent legalese, particularly when they refer to the benefits of being "a little bit more client focused" than their peers. "A lot of comedians are very focused on themselves, but once you're in the law environment, you become a product and you are being sold," Fraser says.</p>

<p>"Part of that is figuring out what you offer the client. So for comedy, it's not 'how do I make myself a star' but 'what do I bring to the table that the audience might want'?"</p>
